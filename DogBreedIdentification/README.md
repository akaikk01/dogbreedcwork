# Dog Breed Identification Project

## Introduction
This project identifies the closest dog breed match for an uknown DNA sequence by comparing it against a database of known dog breed sequences. It performs DNA sequence analysis to find this match and then generates a phylogenetic tree to show the relationship of the uknown sample to the known dog breeds.
## File content
The 'dog_breeds.fa' file contains database sequences.
The 'mystery.fa' file contains a sequence from an unknown dog breed.
The 'coursework.py' file is the main python script that carries out the comparison between the mystery DNA and our database, then creates a phylogenetic tree based on the analysis.
The 'phylogenetic_tree.xml' file was generated by the script, it visualises how closely related the unidentified breed is to known breeds.

## Running the script 
To run this script you have to make sure you have Python 3 and the BioPython libraries installed on your computer !!!
## Modules used:
'SeqIO': for reading sequence data.
'PairwiseAligner', 'MultipleSeqAlignment': for sequence alignment.
'Phylo', 'DistanceCalculator', 'DistanceTreeConstructor': for phylogenetic tree construction.
